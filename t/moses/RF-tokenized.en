Statement of Government Policy by the Prime Minister , Mr Ingvar Carlsson , at the Opening of the Swedish Parliament on Tuesday , 4 October , 1988 .
Your Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , Mr Speaker , Members of the Swedish Parliament .
Sweden 's policy of neutrality is of decisive importance for our peace and independence .
It also contributes to stability and détente in our part of the world .
There is wide popular support for this policy .
It will be pursued with firmness and consistency .
Our policy of neutrality is underpinned by a strong defence . That safeguards our independence .
Violations of Swedish territory will never be accepted .
The army will be reorganized with the aim of making it more effective .
It is the Government 's intention to seek broad solutions in issues that are of importance for our national security .
The Government welcomed the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons .
Efforts must now , among other things , aim at reducing strategic arms and bringing about a comprehensive test ban treaty .
Sweden is acting in support of this inter alia within the framework of the Six Nation Initiative .
The Government will continue its active efforts on behalf of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Nordic area and of a corridor in Central Europe free of battlefield nuclear weapons .
By supporting economic and social progress in developing countries the Government wishes to contribute to reversing the economic decline in the poor countries and to alleviating the debt crisis .
Development assistance shall furthermore promote a sustainable use of natural resources and protection of the environment .
The Government will actively promote the convening in 1992 of a global United Nations conference on the environment and development .
In Central America the five Presidents have signed a peace plan which Sweden has given its wholehearted support .
Negotiations are in progress on peace between Iran and Iraq .
The Soviet troops are in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan .
In the majority of the regional conflicts the United Nations has been able to make important contributions .
Sweden is participating in , among other things , the United Nations Military Observer Groups in Afghanistan and in Iran / Iraq .
We were pleased to learn that the Nobel Peace Prize is being awarded this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces .
Sweden has participated in practically all the United Nations operations of this kind .
It is also an honour for Sweden that the Secretary-General , in consultation with the parties , has appointed our United Nations Ambassador to be his personal representative at the peace negotiations between Iran and Iraq .
The degrading apartheid system in South Africa must be abolished .
A decision by the United Nations Security Council on mandatory sanctions against South Africa would be the most effective measure to this end .
The conflict in the Middle East is among the most difficult to solve .
The Government actively supports the endeavours to convene an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations .
Sweden is dependent on free exchanges of goods and services across national boundaries .
We are setting the pace in the current negotiations to strengthen free trade .
Within the framework of EFTA and in collaboration with the other EFTA countries , the Government will intensify co-operation wit the EC in all fields to the extent it is compatible with our policy of neutrality .
Nordic co-operation will also be developed .
In this context , the requirements of full employment , welfare , a good working environment and trade union participation will be key issues .
Opportunities for study , work and cultural exchanges across national boundaries will be extended .
The Government intends to uphold and strengthen the rule of law in several ways .
The possibilities for courts and public prosecution authorities to carry out their important work will be improved .
The Government will put forward proposals for developing police work and making it more effective .
A proposal for a lower legal limit for the offence of driving with ability impaired by alcohol will be submitted to Parliament .
Crime prevention work at the local level is to be encouraged .
The fight against violence and economic crime will be given priority .
The treatment of offenders must be administered in such a way that prison escapes are prevented .
At the same time the term in prison and non-institutional care must facilitate rehabilitation after discharge .
The goal of our economic policy is full employment and greater prosperity for the whole nation .
The rate of inflation is too high and must be reduced .
Our budget policy must therefore continue to be tight and strong government finances maintained .
Costly reforms will only be carried through to the extent allowed by economic growth , reappraisal of expenditure and by rationalizations in the public sector .
A shortage of labour and low savings restrict growth and push up prices and costs .
Special measures will therefore be taken in order to encourage saving and make better use of people 's desire to work .
Proposals will be put forward for increasing competition and keeping down costs in areas where price trends are boosting inflation .
A reduction of the marginal income-tax rate in 1989 by 3 percentage points will be proposed in the first place for full-time employees .
Later in the electoral period , proposals will be put forward for an extensive reform of the tax system .
The aim is to stimulate work and saving .
State income-tax will be reduced and capital taxes increased .
The tax system will be simplified and tax avoidance counteracted .
Company taxation will be reformed in the direction of lower rates of tax and broader tax bases .
Indirect taxation is to be reformed too .
In order further to increase employment and meet the shortage of labour the Government will develop its active labour market policy .
Recurrent training in working life and qualified further education will play an important role in this context .
Opportunities for the disabled to participate in working life must be further improved .
Immigrants ' entry into the labour market should be facilitated .
Working life is to be made more secure and just .
The Government will invite the organizations in the labour market and the relevant authorities to participate in a commission on the working environment to make special efforts for the 400,000 workplaces most exposed to hazards .
The commission is to submit proposals for measures that will result in healthier working environments , and which will reduce the many work injuries .
During this electoral period , legislation on a sixth week of annual holiday with pay will be enacted .
This reform will be carried through in stages .
It is essential that the work of breaking down the barriers on the labour market for more flexible choices by both sexes be continued .
It must be made easier for men and women to combine gainful employment and parental responsibility .
Further measures will be taken to increase the number of women in various decision-making assemblies .
The broadening of regional policy that has taken place in recent years in the direction of higher competence , education and an enhanced infrastructure , will continue .
Small companies are responsible for much of the dynamics and renewal in Swedish industry and commerce .
We will therefore continue our efforts to create favourable development opportunities for small companies .
Our generous policy in solidarity with refugees stands firm .
The United Nations efforts for the worlds ' refugees will be given continued strong support .
Racism and xenophobia will be forcefully combated .
Proposals will be submitted to Parliament for a new Aliens Act .
The administration of matters relating to aliens will be speeded up considerably .
Consideration for the environment and the countryside must characterize developments in all fields .
Parliament 's decision on traffic policy is of great importance in this context .
A radical environmental policy presupposes a strong economy .

In 1990 a proposal will be submitted to Parliament on the two reactors at the Barsebäck and Ringhals nuclear power stations that are to be taken out of service in 1995 and 1996 .
The energy system will be modified such that acidification is reduced and climatic effects counteracted .
The Government 's agricultural policy aims to promote farming that thrives without having damaging effects on the environment .
There must be a move from today 's intensive production to farming that better meets the requirements in respect of the environment and regional distribution .
Alternative methods of farming will be stimulated .
Measures will be taken to protect the visual amenity of the open landscape .
International developments will require changes in agricultural subsidies to forms implying less protectionism .

The extension of child care services will continue in accordance with Parliament 's decision .
Through the extra increase of the base amount as of 1 January 1989 , pensioners will receive full compensation for the 1982 devaluation .
The Government intends through , among other things , the work of the National Health Policy Commission to devote considerable attention to the provision of a universal right to high quality health and medical service .
Staff recruitment within the caring services must be improved .
The situation for severely disabled persons and for disabled children and their families will be given special attention .
Care of the elderly will be extended with the aim of creating security , independence and freedom of choice .
The fight against HIV and AIDS will continue as also the fight against drugs .
The Government bill on the nine-year compulsory school is now available for consideration .
The upper secondary school will be reformed .
This means changes in both the vocational and theoretical course programmes .
Places in the upper secondary school will be available to all young people under the age of 20 .
There will be improved co-ordination of adult education , labour market training and personnel training .
The efforts to achieve increased equality and a more even social composition in all study paths will be intensified .
In this context , particular attention will be paid to the situation of young immigrants .
International co-operation within research and development is becoming increasingly important .
The Government will continue its efforts to create good opportunities for Swedish industry and Swedish researchers to participate in international research co-operation .
During the coming electoral period , SEK 300 million will be earmarked for the renewal and development of cultural life .

Resources will be set free for the provision of housing by limiting other construction projects in overheated regions .
Further measures to curb cost trends will be taken .
The policies we pursue in the next three years will leave their mark on developments in this country during the decade to come .
And in the next few years we will have to face challenges with consequences for the next century .
On the threshold of the nineties , we should confirm and strengthen in the long term what must be the basis for future developments too : the economy , full employment and welfare .
We will then also create the scope for action for the renewal and the new efforts which are required in a number of important areas : within environmental and energy policy , in the public sector , in working life , in the area of taxation , and in order to strengthen our co-operation - economic , social and cultural - with other countries .
The preconditions for this the aim and direction of our policy are favourable .
International developments give hope of further steps towards peace , freedom and increased understanding between nations and peoples .
Sweden 's economic situation has improved substantially in recent years .
The level of employment in this country is high .
The welfare state enjoys wide popular support .
There is broad political consensus and support for tackling the environmental problems forcefully .
We have good reason to feel optimistic when looking to the future .
But there is also reason to remind ourselves of how quickly a favourable development can be turned into the direct opposite .
This was the case in the 1970s when the Swedish economy was hit by the severest crisis since the 1930s .
The tasks we have ahead of us , and the danger of rapid dramatic changes , mean that responsibility , and the ability to take political action and to co-operate will be required in the future too .
For the first time in 70 years a new party is now entering Parliament .
I should like to welcome the members of the Environment Party the Greens to what I hope will be inspiring parliamentary work .
We all bear a joint responsibility to make the three coming years good ones for this country and all its inhabitants , for the environment , for our relations with other countries and for our own daily contacts and relations with other people no matter where we have our roots .
It is the Government 's resposibility and aim to put to use all good initiatives , to work for broad solutions and to pursue a policy in the interests of the whole nation .
